Embedded Intelligent Microscopy System - Hardware Setup Instructions

1. Required Components:
   - Arduino Uno R3
   - LEDs (5 pieces)
   - Resistors (220 ohm for LEDs)
   - Potentiometer (10K ohm)
   - DC motor and motor driver module (L298N or similar)
   - USB webcam (for software integration)
   - Breadboard and jumper wires
   - USB cable for Arduino connection
   - Power supply (if needed for motor)

2. Wiring Overview:
   - LED connected with 220-ohm resistor to digital pins 2â€“6.
   - Built-in LED connected to pin 13.
   - Motor driver connected to pins 7 and 8 for forward/backward control.
   - Potentiometer can be connected to analog pin A0 for brightness adjustment.
   - USB webcam connected to laptop for video feed.
   - USB cable connects Arduino to laptop for programming and serial communication.

3. Uploading Code:
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Select the correct board (Arduino Uno) and COM port.
   - Open the appropriate `.ino` file and upload.

4. Testing:
   - Test each module separately before integration.
   - Run serial commands using Python scripts in the software folder.
   - Confirm LED control and motor operation.

5. Safety Guidelines:
   - Disconnect power when wiring.
   - Avoid touching powered circuits.
   - Use resistors to prevent damage to LEDs.
